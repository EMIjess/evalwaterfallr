\title{Makes a waterfall plot}
\usage{
waterfallPlot(df, palette = c("#d7191c", "#2b83ba"), xlab = "", ylab = "",
  xfactors = NULL, offset = 0.3, xtextangle = 90)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe with columns 'variable' (character), 'total' (numeric),  'base' (numeric), 'increase' (numeric), and 'decrease' (numeric). can have additional columns, ignored. Assumed to have starting value as first row and ending value as last row.}

\item{palette, }{default is c("#d7191c","#2b83ba")}

\item{xlab}{title the x axis, default is ""}

\item{ylab}{title the y axis, default is ""}

\item{xfactors}{label the x axis; must equal the number of variables, default is df$variable}

\item{offset}{which sets the width of the floating segments, default is "0.3"}

\item{xtextangle}{changes the angle of text on the x axis, default is 90}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 object
}
\description{
waterfallPlot() : a function that takes a dataframe and creates a waterfall plot as a ggplot2 object which can be further modified
}
