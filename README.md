This package is intended for visualizing evaluated results compared to expected results. It permutes multiplicative parameters into order independent values and produces waterfall plots.

The intended view can be only gross changes, from gross expected to gross evaluated. Or, it can include net changes on either end. Therefore, the net to gross expected and evlauated fractions are one by default, but alternative values can be supplied by the user.
